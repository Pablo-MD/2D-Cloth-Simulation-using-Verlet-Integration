# 2D-Cloth-Simulation-using-Verlet-Integration
A 2 dimensional cloth simulation using Unity, the scripts are written in C#.  With intentions for expanding the options and adding  more complexity

Wanted to make some projects to improve on my skills, so it's possible that something are not well optimized or well thought.

Using primitive pheres and Unity's own line renderer I'm able to create the render of the cloth with the possiblity to change the dimensions of the cloth. Later on, I would like to give the options of create your own cloth, without the necesity of being initially rectangular. 
Also I would like give the cloth a mesh, instead of what I have know.

For the physics, right now, I have used the Verlet's integration as explained by "Coding Maths" and "Sebastian Lague" in some of the videos, however I would also like to code my own thing, using somewhat a more complex version (and maybe more inefficient) with air force, viscosity and so on.

Additionally add and modify some details for improving interation.
